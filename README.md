# Introduction to this article 

Alot of my friends and team mates apart of the scare security team have been asking me alot to write a article on the go programming language, unloucky for them i ended up writing one for just advanced golang rather than straight up the basics of go, so this article will be directed more towards the basics of go, what it can and should be used for, how easy it is, and setting up things such as go.mod files and what not so lets get started.

# Introduction to myself 

Whoami? my name is RE43P3R/ArkAngeL i am a current game cheat developer, systems developer, upcoming cyber security expert and legacy systems developer specializing in languages like Fortran, Perl, Go, Ruby, C++, and other languages among the list. My plan in life with this skill is to teach people how to make secure robust applications with a focus on security and to even maybe make some scripts like the red rabbit framework to benefit all kinds of hackers. As i go on and go to build the golang article on advanced go you will often see me mention about the laziness in most modern day developers, which can cause issues with security and the response of an application. However here i will not be talking about that because i find it quite useless as a begginer to complain and turn you off, but that does not mean i will not be talking about general security.

# The language itself and my personal thoughts 

If you feel like skipping this because it IS VERY WELL BIAS go ahead and skip it, for the people that want to read on lets go about it. Golang has always stuck out as a programming language for me, alot of people do not know how to teach it properly or know how to use it which is why i am writing this article as well for my friends. I have had experience in ALOT of languages such as perl, python, R, Lua, C, C++, Go, Ruby, and so on the list just goes on and out of all of the languages my favorite modern day programming language has to be go. This is due to how fast go is, the architectures and systems it can compile for, the community is amazing and is not as toxic and how truly well go respects data types unlike alot of languages. It also makes you write good english which means if you want to export a variable, constant, or function from another module the first letter of that function variable or constant MUST be capitalized. 

There is a bunch i can say about go but by far golang is the most awkward but amazing language i have come across. Go is a high level language which actually gives you the speed and performance of a low level languages made to perform well.

# Starting off with go, what do you use it for? 


In short the go programming language is a statically typed programming language which means it has primitive data types like int, string, uint, float, byte and even arrays such as `[]byte` or `[]string` which is a byte or string array and even has things like aliases to the integer32 data type which is called a rune defined by `rune`.

Now i will not lie to you here and say golang has the best syntax like some people say because it does not, go especially in terms of syntax does have a learning curve but im sure you will be able to figure it out pretty easily. Go has alot of uses like the following 

```
cyber security 

digital forensics such as 
   - Network forensics 
   - Image forensics 
   - File forensics

Data parsing and marshaling

Network services and tools 

Computer science for things like algorithmic implimentation

Encryption

and others...
```

Go makes it easy to do alot of those topics, especially given alot of the packages that go uses for cyber security that are third party were developed by google or members of google if you think about it, it kind of makes you a little bit more trusting of the software that you are using given it was developed by alot of skilled programmers and developers! ( Not saying there are not skilled developers outside of google )
