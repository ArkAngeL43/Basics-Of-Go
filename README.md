# Introduction to this article 

Alot of my friends and team mates apart of the scare security team have been asking me alot to write a article on the go programming language, unloucky for them i ended up writing one for just advanced golang rather than straight up the basics of go, so this article will be directed more towards the basics of go, what it can and should be used for, how easy it is, and setting up things such as go.mod files and what not so lets get started.

# Introduction to myself 

Whoami? my name is RE43P3R/ArkAngeL i am a current game cheat developer, systems developer, upcoming cyber security expert and legacy systems developer specializing in languages like Fortran, Perl, Go, Ruby, C++, and other languages among the list. My plan in life with this skill is to teach people how to make secure robust applications with a focus on security and to even maybe make some scripts like the red rabbit framework to benefit all kinds of hackers
